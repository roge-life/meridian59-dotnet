# Compatibility / Downloads
I do not provide any binaries of OgreClient myself. Instead you can download it from various server that support it.

By default, software included in this repository (e.g. [OgreClient](https://github.com/cyberjunk/meridian59-dotnet/wiki/Meridian59.Ogre.Client)) is only compatible with the technically most advanced servers/versions of the game. As of today these are:

 * Server 105 | [MeridianNext](https://meridiannext.com) | US | Multi-Language
 * Server 112 | [Meridian59de](https://meridian59.de) | EU | Multi-Language


I also try to maintain basic compatibility with older/less technically advanced versions of the game such as [OpenMeridian](http://openmeridian.org/) or [Meridian59com](https://www.meridian59.com), but due to certain important features not being implemented on these branches the experience when playing OgreClient can suffer and I do not guarantee any compatibility. You are also advised to make sure that OgreClient is actually allowed on your server before using it!

## Supported Versions of the Game

You can build binaries compatible with different branches of the game by using preprocessor macros. See the table below for the options and the supported branches. Others might work if they build on top of one of these and haven't technically changed too much.

|  Server  | Macro            | Compatibility | Website             |
|----------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|
|   105    | -                |  **Full**     | [MeridianNext](https://meridiannext.com) |
|   112    | -                |  **Full**     | [Meridian59de](https://meridian59.de)    |
|   103    | OPENMERIDIAN     |  Low          | [OpenMeridian](http://openmeridian.org/) |
| 101/102  | VANILLA          |  Minimal      | [Meridian59com](http://www.meridian59.com) |
